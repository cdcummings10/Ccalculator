# Prework Calculator
## Problem Domain

Inside the Program.cs file of your console application you should have 4 external methods plus the Main method:
Add()
Subtract()
Multiply()
Divide()
Each of these methods should take in 2 parameters, and return the solution of those 2 numbers. (i.e if you are adding 2 numbers than your return would be the sum of the 2 numbers added together. )


Created a calculator that does the four basic functions: Addition, Subtration, Multiplication, Division.
